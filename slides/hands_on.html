# Hand-On

- The goal is to give you a feel for a test-driven workflow using VUnit

- You will be given:
  1. A simple task
  1. A skeleton Test Bench and DUT
  1. A set of incremental steps to perform

- The steps will lead to a working & verified DUT

- I hope everyone will have time to complete the basic steps

- After the basic steps there are a few stretch goals for the faster participants

---

# The Task

- Implement a Tag-Length-Value (**TLV**) stream extractor (`tlv_extractor`)

- A **TLV** stream consists of variable sized packets with
single byte *tag* and *length* fields followed by a *value* of
*length* (0-255) bytes

- The `tlv_extractor` should consume a **TLV**-stream one byte at a time

- The `tlv_extractor` should output a new **TLV**-stream for a specific *tag* only and ignore other *tags*

- The tlv_extractor has a generic defining the *tag* to extract

---

# TLV Extractor
```vhdl
entity tlv_extractor is
  generic (
    -- The tag to extract
    tag : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  );
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;

    -- Input stream of bytes
    in_tvalid : in std_logic;
    in_tdata : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);

    -- Output stream of extracted bytes
    out_tvalid : out std_logic;
    out_tdata : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
```

---

# Some advice
- Follow the steps, it is the point of the lab

- Do **not** focus on synthesis aspects of the DUT

  - Foremost since this is simple lab with limited time

  - Also it is often a good workflow to first create a complete test
  bench for a non-synthesizeable DUT and handle synthesis aspects
  while leaning on a good test bench

---

# Step 1 - Stimuli

- In the main process of the test bench implement a for loop which streams random data into the DUT.

    - The data has to be complete legal **TLV** packets

- Use OSVVM `RandomPkg` to create random data.

- You are done when the test bench is <font color="#98C379"><b>passing</b></font>, the DUT is not touched in this step

```vhdl
library osvvm;
use osvvm.RandomPkg.all;
...
main : process
  variable rnd : RandomPType;
begin
  ...
  rnd.InitSeed(rnd'instance_name);
  byte := rnd.RandSlv(0, 255, 8);
  ...
end process;
```

---

# Step 2 - Data checking

- Create a data checker process that consumes the output stream
  - Check that the DUT extracts **all** data through to the output for now

- Use a `queue_t` to pass data from main process to the checker process

- Add wait for empty queue to the main process

- Add `test_runner_watchdog` to fail the test bench with timeout due to no output from the DUT

- You are done when the test bench is <font color="#E06C75"><b>failing</b></font>, the DUT is not touched in this step


```vhdl
library vunit_lib;
context vunit_lib.data_types_context;

architecture tb of tb_tlv_extractor is
   constant queue : queue_t := new_queue;
begin
```

---

# Step 3 - Make it pass
- Implement enough code in the DUT to <font color="#98C379"><b>pass</b></font> the test bench from the previous step and **no** more

---

# Step 4 - Refactor

- Create a dedicated stimuli process

- Use another `queue_t` to pass data from the main process to the stimuli process

- Synchronize with the stimuli and checker queues being empty in the main process

- Test bench should still <font color="#98C379"><b>pass</b></font>
---

# Step 5 - Refactor some more

- Refactor data generation code into a procedure in the main process

- Test bench should still <font color="#98C379"><b>pass</b></font>

```vhdl
procedure create_tlv_data(tag : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0),
                          length : natural);
```

---

# Step 6 - Make a named test case

- Add a `should_extract` Boolean argument to the `create_tlv_data` procedure
  - Data is only pushed to the checker queue if `should_extract` is true

- Create a new test case called *"Test all packets are extracted"*

- Use `create_tlv_data` to create a few packets **all** containing the *extraction_tag*

- Test bench should still <font color="#98C379"><b>pass</b></font> since all data is extracted by the DUT

```vhdl
if run("Test all packets are extracted") then
  -- Add a few packets, all with the extraction tag
  create_tlv_data(tag => extraction_tag, length => 11,
                  should_extract => true);
  ...
end if;
```

---

# Step 7 - Add a failing test

- Create a new test case called *"Test not all packets are extracted"*

- Use `create_tlv_data` to create a few packets where some do not contain the *extraction_tag*

```vhdl
elsif run("Test not all packets are extracted") then
  -- Add a few packets, some with the extraction tag and some without
  create_tlv_data(tag => not extraction_tag, length => 11,
                  should_extract => false);
  ...
end if;
```

- You are done when the test bench is <font color="#E06C75"><b>failing</b></font> sincethe DUT will extract everything

---

# Step 8 - Make it pass
- Implement enough code in the DUT to <font color="#98C379"><b>pass</b></font> the test bench from the previous step

---

# Are you done?
- Will it work for zero length values?

- Will it work with `in_tvalid` low during random gaps?

- Will it work for the maximum length value?

---

# Stretch goals
- Add named directed tests for corner cases

  - Zero length

  - Maximum length

  - Sequence of zero length non-extracted and extracted tags

- Add test named *"Test random"* which will push a large number of random packets into the DUT

- Add a test named *"Test random in_tvalid"* which will have random gaps with in_tvalid low

Did you find any defects with the additional tests?

---

# If you are done

- Optimize for synthesis

- Would you have introduced defects when optimizing for synthesis without having the test bench to lean on?
  - This is a simple DUT, what would happen for a complex DUT?
